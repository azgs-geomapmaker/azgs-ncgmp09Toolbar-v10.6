How to perform a Build into a new version

The ESRI version upgrade procedures do not work. Much cleaner to build a new project from scatch as follows:
 
- Create a new project with same name - set the project temple as ArcMap Add-In. Set the .NET Framework to 4.52 (or higher)
- Manually add all ESRI and system references need for project. Set the Embedded Interop Property to false
 for each one. 
- Add new resource file in default project location.
- Create new folders for Image and Cursor resources - add all files to project.
- Create new folders for Forms and Utilities. 
- Add Form and Utility code files to project - Add .cs files only to project, let the Visual studio build
  the designer and resource files.
- Create all ESRI Add-in Widgets from scratch. Start from the bottom up, build the containers (menus, toolbar, editor) last. 
  Add image and cursor references in the the ESRI wizard, (its hard to fix after you build) to get the resources properly loaded.
- Name all widgets the same as previous version, then cut and paste executable code into new code files. 
- Do not modify new Assembly, designer, resource or config files, let system manage this. The Config.esriaddinx can be modified..

- If you do have to make resource modifications, note that this version of Visual Studio has a bug.  Keep the Resources.Designer.cs file open
  as you making changes, and they will get updated (not 100% reliable, may had to add and delete a coule times to get them to take).

Debug
- After each change, must do a project build, unload add-in in ArcMap, reload, then in visual studio, attach to arcmap process.  This
  version of Visual studio, cannot start the process within the debugger.

Page Layout Fixes

- Toolbar Bug - SysInfo table does not get updated correctly when
  error occurs, causing subsequent failures.  sysInfo should have
  Next ID to use for each table, and it the ID should be gretaer than
  all exisitng records for the table.

- Identified PageLayout Bug in 10.4 Fixed with DLL Hack. Replace
  ArcMap representationDB.dll with 10.6 version fixes zoom crashes.
  See instructions

- Design Flaw in toolbar for layout.  The graphics  objects were
  created in an editor session, they do not get completed
  moved out of the editor thread when closing and saving, leading
  to crashes.  By turning off events and unslectin all created
  objects minimize this problem, but not entirely fixed.  
  This part of the code should be rewritten to not use
  the editor for these functions.  Maybe in the next version...
